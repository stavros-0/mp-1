                <p>The Intelligent Investor is another long book that goes into detail the investing strategy of
                    Benjamin Graham.</p>
                <p>Benjamin Graham became one of the most well known investors during the Great Depression.</p>
                <p>His investment style is a reflection of the difficult time period that he lived through.</p>
                <p>After the Great Depression and the crash of the stock market, people lost their trust in the stock
                    market.</p>
                <p>However, Graham was able to find a bullet proof investment principle that buys companies for less
                    than what they were worth.</p>
